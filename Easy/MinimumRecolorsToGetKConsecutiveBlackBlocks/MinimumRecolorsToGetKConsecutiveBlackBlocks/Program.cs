             * Explanation:
                One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
                so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
                It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
                Therefore, we return 3.
